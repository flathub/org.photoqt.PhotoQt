-                <p>After many months of hard work, the first beta release of v5.0 is ready for testing. There are likely still some bugs and some things might need a bit more polishing. I'm looking for help with testing it, the more people do that and report back their feedback the better.</p>

             <description>
                 <p>On the way to 5.0, the existing code has undergone some significant restructuring and profiling. Instead of keeping all of these performance improvements and bug fixes for v5.0, another minor release, v4.9.2, provides access to these changes much earlier.</p>
